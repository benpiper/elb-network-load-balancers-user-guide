<p>Elastic Load Balancing publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your load balancers and your targets. CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data, known as <em>metrics</em>. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as the values of that variable over time. For example, you can monitor the total number of healthy targets for a load balancer over a specified time period. Each data point has an associated time stamp and an optional unit of measurement.</p>
<p>You can use metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor a specified metric and initiate an action (such as sending a notification to an email address) if the metric goes outside what you consider an acceptable range.</p>
<p>Elastic Load Balancing reports metrics to CloudWatch only when requests are flowing through the load balancer. If there are requests flowing through the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing measures and sends its metrics in 60-second intervals. If there are no requests flowing through the load balancer or no data for a metric, the metric is not reported.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/">Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="statistics-for-network-load-balancer-metrics">Statistics for Network Load Balancer metrics<a name="metric-statistics"></a></h2>
<p>CloudWatch provides statistics based on the metric data points published by Elastic Load Balancing. Statistics are metric data aggregations over specified period of time. When you request statistics, the returned data stream is identified by the metric name and dimension. A dimension is a name/value pair that uniquely identifies a metric. For example, you can request statistics for all the healthy EC2 instances behind a load balancer launched in a specific Availability Zone.</p>
<p>The <code>Minimum</code> and <code>Maximum</code> statistics reflect the minimum and maximum values of the data points reported by the individual load balancer nodes in each sampling window. Increases in the maximum of <code>HealthyHostCount</code> correspond to decreases in the minimum of <code>UnHealthyHostCount</code>. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor your Network Load Balancer using either the maximum of <code>HealthyHostCount</code> or the minimum of <code>UnHealthyHostCount</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Sum</code> statistic is the aggregate value across all load balancer nodes. Because metrics include multiple reports per period, <code>Sum</code> is only applicable to metrics that are aggregated across all load balancer nodes.</p>
<p>The <code>SampleCount</code> statistic is the number of samples measured. Because metrics are gathered based on sampling intervals and events, this statistic is typically not useful. For example, with <code>HealthyHostCount</code>, <code>SampleCount</code> is based on the number of samples that each load balancer node reports, not the number of healthy hosts.</p>

<p><strong>To get the statistics for a metric using the AWS CLI</strong><br>
Use the following <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.html">get-metric-statistics</a> command get statistics for the specified metric and dimension. Note that CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. You can't retrieve statistics using combinations of dimensions that were not specially published. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created.</p>
<pre><code>aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/NetworkELB \
