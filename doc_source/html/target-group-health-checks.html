<h1 id="health-checks-for-your-target-groups">Health checks for your target groups<a name="target-group-health-checks"></a></h1>
<p>You register your targets with one or more target groups. The load balancer starts routing requests to a newly registered target as soon as the registration process completes. It can take a few minutes for the registration process to complete and health checks to start.</p>
<p>Network Load Balancers use active and passive health checks to determine whether a target is available to handle requests. By default, each load balancer node routes requests only to the healthy targets in its Availability Zone. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node routes requests to the healthy targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see <a href="network-load-balancers.html#cross-zone-load-balancing">Cross-zone load balancing</a>.</p>
<p>With active health checks, the load balancer periodically sends a request to each registered target to check its status. Each load balancer node checks the health of each target, using the health check settings for the target group with which the target is registered. After each health check is completed, the load balancer node closes the connection that was established for the health check.</p>
<p>With passive health checks, the load balancer observes how targets respond to connections. Passive health checks enable the load balancer to detect an unhealthy target before it is reported as unhealthy by the active health checks. You cannot disable, configure, or monitor passive health checks. Passive health checks are not supported for UDP traffic.</p>
<p>If a target becomes unhealthy, the load balancer sends a TCP RST for packets received on the client connections associated with the target, unless the unhealthy target triggers the load balancer to fail open.</p>
<p>If target groups don’t have a healthy target in an enabled Availability Zone, we remove the IP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS so that requests cannot be routed to targets in that Availability Zone. If all targets fail health checks at the same time in all enabled Availability Zones, the load balancer fails open. The effect of the fail open is to allow traffic to all targets in all enabled Availability Zones, regardless of their health status.</p>
<p>If a target group is configured with HTTPS health checks, its registered targets fail health checks if they support only TLS 1.3. These targets must support an earlier version of TLS, such as TLS 1.2.</p>
<p>For HTTP or HTTPS health check requests, the host header contains the IP address of the load balancer node and the listener port, not the IP address of the target and the health check port.</p>
<p>If you add a TLS listener to your Network Load Balancer, we perform a listener connectivity test. As TLS termination also terminates a TCP connection, a new TCP connection is established between your load balancer and your targets. Therefore, you might see the TCP pings for this test sent from your load balancer to the targets that are registered with your TLS listener. You can identify these TCP pings because they have the source IP address of your Network Load Balancer and the connections do not contain data packets.</p>
<p>For a UDP service, target availability can be tested using non-UDP health checks on your target group. You can use any available health check (TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS), and any port on your target to verify the availability of a UDP service. If the service receiving the health check fails, your target is considered unavailable. To improve the accuracy of health checks for a UDP service, configure the service listening to the health check port to track the status of your UDP service and fail the health check if the service is unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="health-check-settings">Health check settings<a name="health-check-settings"></a></h2>
<p>You configure active health checks for the targets in a target group using the following settings. If the health checks exceed <strong>UnhealthyThresholdCount</strong> consecutive failures, the load balancer takes the target out of service. When the health checks exceed <strong>HealthyThresholdCount</strong> consecutive successes, the load balancer puts the target back in service.</p>
