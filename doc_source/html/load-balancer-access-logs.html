<h1 id="access-logs-for-your-network-load-balancer">Access logs for your Network Load Balancer<a name="load-balancer-access-logs"></a></h1>
<p>Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about the TLS requests sent to your Network Load Balancer. You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong><br />
Access logs are created only if the load balancer has a TLS listener and they contain information only about TLS requests.</p>
<p>Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is disabled by default. After you enable access logging for your load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing captures the logs as compressed files and stores them in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can disable access logging at any time.</p>
<p>You can enable server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), or using Key Management Service with Customer Managed Keys (SSE-KMS CMK) for your S3 bucket. Each access log file is automatically encrypted before it is stored in your S3 bucket and decrypted when you access it. You do not need to take any action as there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted log files. Each log file is encrypted with a unique key, which is itself encrypted with a master key that is regularly rotated. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-s3-encryption.html">Specifying Amazon S3 encryption (SSE-S3)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-kms-encryption.html">Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS)</a> in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.</p>
<p>There is no additional charge for access logs. You are charged storage costs for Amazon S3, but not charged for the bandwidth used by Elastic Load Balancing to send log files to Amazon S3. For more information about storage costs, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="access-log-files">Access log files<a name="access-log-file-format"></a></h2>
<p>Elastic Load Balancing publishes a log file for each load balancer node every 5 minutes. Log delivery is eventually consistent. The load balancer can deliver multiple logs for the same period. This usually happens if the site has high traffic.</p>
<p>The file names of the access logs use the following format:</p>
<pre><code>bucket[/prefix]/AWSLogs/aws-account-id/elasticloadbalancing/region/yyyy/mm/dd/aws-account-id_elasticloadbalancing_region_net.load-balancer-id_end-time_random-string.log.gz</code></pre>
<p><em>bucket</em><br />
The name of the S3 bucket.</p>
<p><em>prefix</em><br />
The prefix (logical hierarchy) in the bucket. If you don’t specify a prefix, the logs are placed at the root level of the bucket.</p>
<p><em>aws-account-id</em><br />
The AWS account ID of the owner.</p>
<p><em>region</em><br />
The region for your load balancer and S3 bucket.</p>
<p><em>yyyy</em>/<em>mm</em>/<em>dd</em><br />
The date that the log was delivered.</p>
<p><em>load-balancer-id</em><br />
The resource ID of the load balancer. If the resource ID contains any forward slashes (/), they are replaced with periods (.).</p>
<p><em>end-time</em><br />
The date and time that the logging interval ended. For example, an end time of 20181220T2340Z contains entries for requests made between 23:35 and 23:40.</p>
<p><em>random-string</em><br />
A system-generated random string.</p>
<p>The following is an example log file name:</p>
<pre><code>s3://my-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/123456789012/elasticloadbalancing/us-east-2/2020/05/01/123456789012_elasticloadbalancing_us-east-2_net.my-loadbalancer.1234567890abcdef_20200501T0000Z_20sg8hgm.log.gz</code></pre>
<p>You can store your log files in your bucket for as long as you want, but you can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Manage your storage lifecycle</a> in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em>.</p>

<p>The following table describes the fields of an access log entry, in order. All fields are delimited by spaces. When new fields are introduced, they are added to the end of the log entry. When processing the log files, you should ignore any fields at the end of the log entry that you were not expecting.</p>

<h2 id="bucket-requirements">Bucket requirements<a name="access-logging-bucket-requirements"></a></h2>
<p>When you enable access logging, you must specify an S3 bucket for the access logs. The bucket can be owned by a different account than the account that owns the load balancer. The bucket must meet the following requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong> + The bucket must be located in the same region as the load balancer. + The prefix that you specify must not include AWSLogs. We add the portion of the file name starting with AWSLogs after the bucket name and prefix that you specify. + The bucket must have a bucket policy that grants permission to write the access logs to your bucket. Bucket policies are a collection of JSON statements written in the access policy language to define access permissions for your bucket. The following is an example policy.</p>
<pre><code>{

**Encryption**

You can enable server\-side encryption for your Amazon S3 access log bucket in one of the following ways:
+ Amazon S3\-Managed Keys \(SSE\-S3\)
+ AWS KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service \(SSE\-KMS\) †

† With Network Load Balancer access logs, you can&#39;t use AWS managed keys, you must use customer managed keys\.

For more information, see [Specifying Amazon S3 encryption \(SSE\-S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-s3-encryption.html) and [Specifying server\-side encryption with AWS KMS \(SSE\-KMS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-kms-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*\.

The key policy must allow the service to encrypt and decrypt the logs\. The following is an example policy\.
</code></pre>
<p>{ “Version”: “2012-10-17”, “Statement”: [ { “Effect”: “Allow”, “Principal”: { “Service”: “delivery.logs.amazonaws.com” }, “Action”: [ “kms:Encrypt”, “kms:Decrypt”, “kms:ReEncrypt<em>", "kms:GenerateDataKey</em>”, “kms:DescribeKey” ], “Resource”: "*" } ] } ```</p>
